# Lab Specification
*Interval Trees*

## Starting materials
- You are given `IntervalTree.h`. You should not modify this file.
  - `IntervalTree.h` contains the base class `IntervalTree`, which you will inherit.

## Intervals
- And interval has a lower and upper bound
  - For the purposes of our lab, the lower bound is **inclusive**, and the upper bound is **exclusive**
- Logic defining the qualities of intervals can be found in the `Interval` struct in `IntervalTree.h`

## Augmented Interval Tree
An *Augmented Interval Tree* (AIT) is a specialized Binary Search Tree (BST) that stores intervals instead of single values.
- Each AIT node also stores a "min-max" interval that defines the minimum lower bound and maximum upper bound of the local subtree.
  - See `Node` in `IntervalTree.h`

## Requirements
1. Create a class called `AugmentedIntervalTree` that inherits from `IntervalTree` (found in `IntervalTree.h`)
   1. Your class should be stored in `AugmentedIntervalTree.h`
      1. You do not need to separate your code into separate `.h` and `.cpp` files, though you may choose to do so if you desire.
      2. If you do write an `AugmentedIntervalTree.cpp`, be sure to submit it in addition to the other files.
        1. Note: it can be tricky to implement templated classes in a `.cpp`, so only attempt this if you know the issues and their solutions.
   2. This class must implement all the pure virtual functions found in `IntervalTree.h`
   3. This class is expected to not have any memory leaks 
2. Write your own `tests.cpp`
   1. This file should contain a `int main() {...}` method that runs your tests
   2. You should include tests that exercise all the methods overridden in `AugmentedIntervalTree`
      1. You do not need to test large datasets, but you should try to verify that your code works properly
3. Write a `makefile`
   1. Target `test` should build a clean copy of your test binary and run your tests with valgrind
      1. **IMPORTANT** Do **not** include the `-s` flag for valgrind. See example makefile below.
4. Submit `AugmentedIntervalTree.h`, `tests.cpp`, and `makefile`

### Example `makefile`

*Be sure to use tabs and not spaces for indentation!*

```makefile
build:
    g++ -g -std=c++11 -o test tests.cpp

test: build
    valgrind --leak-check=full ./test
```

## How to get started

- Download the lab files
- Create a file named `AugmentedIntervalTree.h`
  - `AugmentedIntervalTree` should extend `IntervalTree`
- Stub out implementations of the inherited virtual methods
  - Simple `cout` statements and dummy return values
- Create a file named `my_tests.cpp`
  - Start with a simple `main` method that creates an `AugmentedIntervalTree`
- Create a `makefile` that looks like the example above
- **Make sure your code compiles before moving on!**
  - `make test` should run without errors
- For each of the following methods: `~AugmentedIntervalTree`, `is_empty`, `add`, `clear`, `query`, `remove`
  - Write tests that exercise that method and assert the state of the tree after the method is called
    - The new tests should fail
  - Implement the method
    - The tests should now pass
  - Once the last feature is well tested, move to the next feature
    - Keep the old tests: they will help you catch errors you introduce while implementing later features
- Things to test (not an exhaustive list):
  - Adding duplicate intervals
  - Remove intervals that aren't present
  - Add after clear
  - Query on empty
  - Query on boundaries (inclusive vs exclusive)
  - Remove on an empty tree
  - Query after remove
  - Structure after add and remove
  - Empty after clear?
- Other things to remember:
  - Make sure `query` uses an **inoder** traversal so the output is sorted
  - No memory leaks
  - To refer to `root` in your child class, use `this->root`. Do NOT override `root`, or this will cause the `to_string` method in the parent class to return the empty string.
- Turn in `AugmentedIntervalTree.h`, `my_tests.cpp`, and `makefile`

## Points

- 10 points for tests written by you
  - 2 points each for `is_empty`, `add`, `clear`, `query`, and `remove`
- 90 points for autograder tests
  - 20 points for basic tests of `add`, `clear` and `is_empty`
  - 20 points for basic tests of `add` and `query`
  - 20 points for basic tests of `add`, `query`, and `remove`
  - 10 points for advanced tests
  - 20 points for no memory leaks on all tests
